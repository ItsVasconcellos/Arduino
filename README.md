This repository was created to share the Arduino projects made throughout the year of 2022.
Most of the projects were part of a mandatory class of the third year of  the IT course taken at Unicamp - Cotil.
Unfortunately, GitHub does not allow to post the physical part of the system, so for this reason my TinkerCad profile is linked below.
